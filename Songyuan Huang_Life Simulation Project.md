<b>Life Simulation</b>

<b>Project Abstract:</b>
<p>This life simulation project is basically a casual text based game in which players are only required to click the next button to continue the game. The game will randomly generate events and status for players for their gameplay story. As players will encounter different events and have different statuses will lead players to different endings.<p>

<b>Project Relevance: </b>
<p>This project will be linked to the educational goals as the project will be using and practice on Parallel Computing, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Design Patterns, Debugging, Extensible Markup Language (XML), Graphic User Interface, and Access to Database. The main focus of this project is to practice access to databases as this project will connect it to Excel spreadsheets database in order to gain access to information. This project will also meet the educational goals for this course as it contains management, design, development, documentation, testing, and maintenance for the project.</p>

<b>Conceptual Design: </b>
<p>This project is a simple casual text-based game that only requires only a click on a button to play. Every time a button is clicked a text will pop up that will show a piece of event information. At the beginning of the game, a random status for a newborn baby will be generated. As players click a button the game will be processed as a baby getting a year older and an event will be randomly generated which will get it from the Excel spreadsheets as the spreadsheets will be the database that stores different events. As the player is getting older, the higher chance that player will game over as they die from old age, there will also be the possibility that the player will die from an accident. When the player dies, a button will show up for the player to start a new game.
