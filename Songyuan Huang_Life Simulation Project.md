<h1>Life Simulation</h1>
<br/>

<b>Project Abstract:</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This life simulation project is basically a casual text based game in which players are only required to click the next button to continue the game. The game will randomly generate events and status for players for their gameplay story. As players will encounter different events and have different statuses will lead players to different endings.<p>

<b>Project Relevance: </b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This project will be linked to the educational goals as the project will be using and practice on Parallel Computing, Unified Modeling Language (UML), Design Patterns, Debugging, Extensible Markup Language (XML), Graphic User Interface, and Access to Database. The main focus of this project is to practice access to databases as this project will connect it to Excel spreadsheets database in order to gain access to information. This project will also meet the educational goals for this course as it contains management, design, development, documentation, testing, and maintenance for the project.</p>

</br>

<b>Conceptual Design: </b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This project is a simple casual text-based game that only requires only a click on a button to play. Every time a button is clicked a text will pop up that will show a piece of event information. At the beginning of the game, a random status for a newborn baby will be generated. As players click a button the game will be processed as a baby getting a year older and an event will be randomly generated which will get it from the Excel spreadsheets as the spreadsheets will be the database that stores different events. As the player is getting older, the higher chance that player will game over as they die from old age, there will also be the possibility that the player will die from an accident. When the player dies, a button will show up for the player to start a new game.

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Building</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;  This project is to build with either Python or Java and use Excel spreadsheets as a database to get access to info. The project is to build a game that is similar to the provided link, and it uses that as a blueprint. The game will be more simple than the game from the provided link, if time permits then more features will be added to the project. </p>

<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Running</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as the game wonâ€™t have major errors that appear, for example, crush the game or freeze the game, and the game is able to access the database and get info from it, then the game is halfway from success. When the game is running smoothly as the original game plan with either Python or Java, then the game is successfully running.</p>
